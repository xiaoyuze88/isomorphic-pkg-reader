# isomorphic-pkg-reader
Read IOS/Android package's(.apk/.ipa ) manifest info, for NodeJS/Webpack/Browserify.

## Introduction
For `.apk`, parse the `AndroidManifest.xml` and `resources.arsc` files, read all values listed in AndroidManifest.xml(both primitive and reference type), also you can get and show the icon of the apk file directly from the parsed result.

For `.ipa`, parse the `info.plist` and `embedded.mobileprovision` files, read all basic information in info.plist file, including the icon of the ipa file(already handled the crushed pngs).
